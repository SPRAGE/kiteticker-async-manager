# Auto-Release Script Error Handling

## 🛡️ Robust Error Handling

The auto-release script now includes comprehensive error handling to prevent failures and data loss.

## 🔧 Failure Scenarios & Solutions

### 1. **Clippy Auto-Fix Failures**

#### What Could Go Wrong:
- `cargo clippy --fix` encounters compilation errors
- Auto-fixes create syntax errors
- Some clippy issues can't be auto-fixed

#### How It's Handled:
```bash
# ✅ Before fix
if cargo clippy --fix --allow-dirty --allow-staged --all-features 2>/dev/null; then
    print_success "Auto-fixed clippy suggestions"
    CHANGES_MADE=true
else
    # Check if failure was due to compilation errors
    if ! cargo check --all-features > /dev/null 2>&1; then
        print_error "Code has compilation errors that prevent auto-fix!"
        rollback_changes  # ← Automatic rollback
        exit 1
    fi
fi
```

### 2. **Test Failures After Auto-Fixes**

#### What Could Go Wrong:
- Auto-formatting breaks code semantics
- Clippy fixes introduce logical errors
- Tests fail after "fixes"

#### How It's Handled:
```bash
# ✅ All test functions include rollback
if ! cargo test --all-features; then
    print_error "❌ Tests failed!"
    rollback_changes  # ← Restore original state
    exit 1
fi
```

### 3. **Working Directory State Management**

#### What Could Go Wrong:
- Script starts with uncommitted changes
- Auto-fixes create more changes
- Mix of user changes and auto-fixes

#### How It's Handled:
```bash
# ✅ Flexible working directory check
if [ -n "$(git status --porcelain)" ]; then
    print_warning "Working directory has uncommitted changes"
    create_backup  # ← Create safety backup
    # Ask user confirmation but don't fail
fi
```

### 4. **Backup and Rollback System**

#### Automatic Backup:
```bash
create_backup() {
    git stash push -u -m "auto-release-backup-$(date +%s)" > /dev/null 2>&1
    BACKUP_CREATED=true
}
```

#### Automatic Rollback:
```bash
rollback_changes() {
    if [ "$BACKUP_CREATED" = true ]; then
        git reset --hard HEAD > /dev/null 2>&1
        git stash pop > /dev/null 2>&1
        print_info "Changes rolled back to original state"
    fi
}
```

## 🚨 When the Script Will Fail (and Exit Safely)

### 1. **Compilation Errors**
```bash
# ❌ Fails but rolls back
./scripts/auto-release.sh patch
# Output: "Code has compilation errors that prevent auto-fix!"
# Result: All changes reverted
```

### 2. **Test Failures**
```bash
# ❌ Fails but rolls back  
./scripts/auto-release.sh minor
# Output: "Tests failed! Please fix failing tests"
# Result: All changes reverted
```

### 3. **Clippy Issues That Can't Be Auto-Fixed**
```bash
# ❌ Fails but rolls back
./scripts/auto-release.sh major
# Output: "Clippy checks failed with remaining issues!"
# Result: All changes reverted
```

### 4. **Security Vulnerabilities**
```bash
# ❌ Fails but rolls back
./scripts/auto-release.sh 1.0.0
# Output: "Security audit failed!"
# Result: All changes reverted
```

### 5. **Publish Readiness Issues**
```bash
# ❌ Fails but rolls back
./scripts/auto-release.sh patch
# Output: "Publish dry run failed!"
# Result: All changes reverted
```

## ✅ When the Script Will Succeed

### Perfect Scenario:
```bash
./scripts/auto-release.sh patch
# ✅ Formats code successfully
# ✅ Auto-fixes clippy issues
# ✅ All tests pass
# ✅ Security audit passes
# ✅ Publish dry-run succeeds
# ✅ Version bumped and committed
# ✅ Tag created and pushed
# 🚀 GitHub Actions triggered
```

## 🔄 Manual Recovery

If something goes wrong outside the script's control:

### Check for Backup:
```bash
git stash list | grep auto-release-backup
```

### Restore Backup:
```bash
git reset --hard HEAD~1    # Remove last commit
git stash apply stash@{0}  # Restore backup
```

### Check Repository State:
```bash
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

## 🧪 Testing the Error Handling

### Test Compilation Error Handling:
```bash
# Introduce syntax error
echo "invalid rust code" >> src/lib.rs
./scripts/auto-release.sh patch
# Should fail and rollback
git status  # Should be clean
```

### Test with Existing Changes:
```bash
# Make some changes
echo "// test change" >> README.md
./scripts/auto-release.sh patch
# Should ask for confirmation and handle gracefully
```

## 📋 Best Practices

1. **Always review changes** after auto-fixes:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~1  # Review what was changed
   ```

2. **Run manual checks** if you're unsure:
   ```bash
   just pre-push  # Run comprehensive checks
   ```

3. **Keep backups** for important releases:
   ```bash
   git branch backup-before-v1.0.0  # Manual backup
   ```

4. **Monitor GitHub Actions** after release:
   - Check the Actions tab for any CI failures
   - Verify publication to crates.io

## 🎯 Summary

The enhanced auto-release script now handles:
- ✅ **Compilation errors** → Rollback
- ✅ **Test failures** → Rollback  
- ✅ **Auto-fix failures** → Rollback
- ✅ **Security issues** → Rollback
- ✅ **Publish issues** → Rollback
- ✅ **Unexpected exits** → Automatic cleanup
- ✅ **Mixed changes** → Proper backup/restore

**Result**: Safe, reliable, one-command releases with automatic error recovery! 🚀
